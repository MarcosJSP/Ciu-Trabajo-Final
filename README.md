# Bulletto Hell Game made on Processing
This game was made in collaboration with [@doramasma](https://github.com/doramasma), [@jeycovo](https://github.com/jeycovo) and [@hectorhcdev](https://github.com/hectorhcdev) for the subject <b>Creando Interfaces de Usuario (CIU) - [ULPGC](https://www.ulpgc.es/)</b>. I was in charge of doing the design and layout and also participated in the development of the color recognition system. As the project progressed, serious problems were detected regarding the performance, so I also took care of the optimization of the game.

As the name of the game suggests, it is a "Bullet Hell" type of game. The game takes place in space and the objective of the player is to get through multiple hordes of enemies to reach the final boss and defeat him to win the game. The player controls a spaceship that constantly fires bullets that can also be momentarily upgraded. The way the player controls the spaceship is through the webcam, via color detection, therefore at the beginning of the game, the player must calibrate the game to detect an item with a specific color. [Here is the teaser of the game](https://youtu.be/yTRe9CaCBQM).
